# Applied Scientist | Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics @ NCSU
 
Data-driven scientist with a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics (May 2025), specializing in **Bayesian modeling**, **Uncertainty Quantification**, and **Machine Learning**. I design algorithms and implement them on models that extract insights from data, quantify risk, and optimize decision-making in complex systems. My work integrates mathematical rigor with scalable computation, delivering predictive tools that drive impactful, real-world solutions.


## üî¨ Recent Highlights  
- Developed a **computationally efficient parameter subset selection algorithm** to identify the most influential parameters in the model for a given dataset 
- Enhanced **Bayesian parameter estimation** pipelines to improve predictive accuracy and model interpretability   
- Built and validated **virtual populations** for synthetic data generation, supporting model-informed decision-making
